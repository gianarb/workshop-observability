As you can see the lesson05 doesn't have solution and this is just for pro!
I put this together because I hope somebody will have time at home or during the
workshop if it is running ahead of schedule to take this challange.

I never run ahead of schedule, that's why I do not have a solution file for this
lesson! We are gonna get over this together.

## Exercise: Connect the dots!

My dream is implement this roles across the applications:

1. All of the should return an header `X-Trace-ID` with the traceID.
2. As you know every span has a SpanContext that is contains a set of k/v
   propagated between application. They are usually good to pass `user_id` or
   other information that makes the context of the request clear. I would like
   to have these set of values printed out by the logger for every message. With
   the `trace_id` too.

## Motivation
Ae we know the secret for an happy life is aggregation. We need to be good at
connecting and exposing traces, events and metrics. This exercise is all about
that.
